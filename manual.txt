HP - 'Health Points'. If your HP falls to 0, you die.
MP - 'Mana Points'. You use these to cast spells.
STAMINA - Your energy. If you let your energy fall low enough, not only will your attacks do less damage but your enemies can do more damage to you.

     Attacks

===========

Light Attack - A regular attack. Takes 1 Stamina to use.

Pounce - A charge attack (takes multiple turns to use,  but deals more damage than a normal attack). Takes 3 Stamina to use.

Rest - Recovers your Stamina. This is very useful if you don't want to die.

Guard - For the turn that you use the move, any physical attacks you take will deal halved damage. Takes 2 Stamina to use.

Guard Break - If an opponent is guarding, you will deal a lot of damage to them. Takes 4 Stamina to use.
